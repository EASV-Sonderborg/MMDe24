        <h2 class="lowertitle_3">What will happen to Ukrain?</h2>
        <p>Now the qestion is. Whats gonna happen to Nato and Ukrain? Ukrain have been in war with Russia in about 2-3 years. And Ukrain getting support by EU and NATO, would that ever stop cause of Trump? Other says yes cause Trump did have a great meeting with the big guy Valdimir Putin and Kim In Jung. And Trump does also have great connection to Chines presidents. But many says Trump wont stop supporting Ukrain so there shouldnt be anything happening of the war.</p>

    <section class="nato">
     <h2 class="lowertitle_4">Nato is getting stronger?</h2>
     <p>Now Trump have been chosen to be the US president, will NATO become even more powerfull in his power? No Trump dont have the power to make NATO to give up on Ukrain or other supporters. Cause its being voted for its not only Trumps vote that counts but many other countrys as well. So Nato wouldnt been stonger or weaker in his power it will be as steady as it is now. Unless NATO is going in a full flects war with Russia and North Korea.</p>
