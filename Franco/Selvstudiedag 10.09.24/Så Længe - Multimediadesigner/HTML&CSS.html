            <h1>HTML & CSS</h1>

            <p>What is html? HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design webpages. It structures web content using elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and lists, defined by tags enclosed in angle brackets.</p>

            <div class="polaroid-container">
                <div class="polaroid">
                    <img class="polaroid-image" src="images/Structure.png" alt="HTML structure">
                
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>HTML provides the backbone of a webpage. It uses elements like head, header, and body to define different parts of the page. The head holds metadata, styles, and scripts. The body contains the main content, such as paragraphs (p) and links (a). Together, these elements form the basic skeleton of a webpage.</p>
            
            <p>To explain it to a kid: HTML is like the blueprint of a house, where each tag represents a different room or piece of furniture, giving structure and order to the space. Just as walls, doors, and windows define the layout of a home, HTML elements shape the way content like text, images, and links are arranged on a webpage, creating the framework for everything else to fit perfectly in place.</p>

            <h2> Class Names, IDs, and Spans</h2>

            <div class="polaroid-container">
                <div class="polaroid">
                    <img class="polaroid-image" src="images/Class.png" alt="Class Example">
                    
                </div>
            
            </div>

            <p>Class names and IDs are essential for targeting elements with CSS. Classes (class="example") can be reused across multiple elements, while IDs (id="unique") should be unique per element.</p>
            
            <p>For example, in the image above, the two Ps have a different class name, so I could identify the content immediately for later styling in CSS.</p>
            
            <p>The span element is used for inline text styling, allowing customization without block-level effects.</p>
            <div class="polaroid">
                <img class="polaroid-image" src="images/Spanclass.png" alt="Span Class Example">
                
            </div>

            <p>For example, here I can put a span to make the UX Design remark pop more, and have a more impactful presence upon reading it. You may have noticed that along the span element, I classified it as ''Impact'', to specify its edit in CSS. This is very important if you have several spans across your HTML file See for yourself:</p>

            <div class="polaroid-container">
                <div class="polaroid">
                    <img class="polaroid-image" src="images/Comparison1.png" alt="Before">
                    
                </div>
                <div class="polaroid">
                    <img class="polaroid-image" src="images/Comparison2.png" alt="After">
                    
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>Container and Sectioning Elements</h2>

            <div class="polaroid-container">
                <div class="polaroid">
                    <img class="polaroid-image" src="images/SectionContainer.png" alt="Section Overview">
                    
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>HTML has special elements to help organize content. Aside from the basic structure elements like head, header and body, you have other elements to help you section your HTML for general styling and self-guidance. You have the div, a versatile block container, while section, article, and nav provide semantic meaning. These tags improve both readability and accessibility, helping browsers and search engines understand your page layout.</p>

            <p>To provide you with an example, I used a Div to specifically target the images of this portfolio's Homepage. This just made it easier for me to distinguish it from the rest of the elements in my messy HTML.</p>

            <div class="polaroid-container">
                <div class="polaroid">
                    <img class="polaroid-image" src="images/Div.png" alt="Div Example">
                    
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <p>I also used a Div for the Nav content in my homepage</p>
            <div class="polaroid">
                <img class="polaroid-image" src="images/HTML example.png" alt="Span Class Example">
                
            </div>
            <p>which brings us to Nav:</p>
            <div class="polaroid-container">
                <div class="polaroid">
                    <img class="polaroid-image" src="images/Nav.png" alt="Nav Example">
                    
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>My homepage, just like any other page, has a navigation section at the top. Nav is navigation for short, and an element we use to identify the content for the header. Here are other examples from known pages:</p>

            <div class="polaroid-container">
                <div class="polaroid">
                    <img class="polaroid-image" src="images/Nav2.png" alt="Elgiganten Nav">
                    
                </div>
                <div class="polaroid">
                    <img class="polaroid-image" src="images/Nav3.png" alt="Amazon Nav">
                    
                </div>
            </div>

           

            <h2>Creating Links</h2>
          
            <p>Links are input as 'a' in html, as you can see in the picture above. Within this 'a', is 'href' which is where you insert a link. Each list item in the navigation section has its own link attached, in order to take you to different pages, THAT is what makes the list interactive.</p>
            <h1>Style.CSS</h1>
            <p>While HTML is the content of a page, style.css is how that content looks like.</p>
            <div class="polaroid">
                <img class="polaroid-image" src="images/Style.jpg" alt="Randomstyle">
                
            </div>
            <h2>Manipulating Page Space</h2>

            <p>Although the content of a page may be sufficient in an informative way, it is the styling that allows for such information to be read comfortably. Style.css provides the means to frame every bit of content in your HTML however you want to, so that people visiting your page navigate through not only aided by lists and images, but also frames, space, and color.</p>

            <div class="polaroid-container">
                <div class="polaroid">
                    <img class="polaroid-image" src="images/Space.png" alt="Space Example">
                    
                </div>
                
                <p>Manipulating the space in your page is a basic concept for playing around with fitting things correctly across the web. By inspecting a page you can see the Margin, Border, and padding of a content box.</p>
                <div class="polaroid">
                    <img class="polaroid-image" src="images/Example1.png" alt="Homepage space">
                    
                </div>
    
            </div>

            <p>As you can see, my homepage has quite a lot of space on the sides, which allows for content to be centered in the middle. The whole content in main is basically a big box, which has its margins, a height, and a width. Editing the max-width allowed me to narrow it down to the middle, and naturally playing around with margin and padding it evens out the proportions of the box. See below:</p>
                <div class="polaroid">
                <img class="polaroid-image" src="images/Main styling.png" alt="Main Box">
                
                </div>
            <p>Note that margin adjusts the space outside of the content box, while padding controls the space inside the content border.</p>
           

            <p>Reflection: I am not comfortable touching too much of the space around my pages, because it can go from looking normal to extremely incomprehensible. Though it really does feel good when you play around with it for a while and get what you want.</p>


            <h2>Alignment & Justification</h2>
            <p>Just like in word document, you can edit the placement of items in your HTML, according to where you want them to be. Text and content alignment are key to good design. <span>text-align</span>, <span>justify-content</span>, and <span>align-items</span> are used to align elements horizontally and vertically. For example, <span>justify-content: center;</span> centers content within its container, creating a balanced layout across different screen sizes.</p>

            <p>That is exactly what I did for my main content in the homepage. I used <span>text-align: center;</span> so the text would not start from the left side of the box, which would look less appealing in my opinion.</p>

            <h2>Editing Specific Classes</h2>
            <p>As we talked about identifying elements, such as classes and IDs, we can use these to single-handedly edit the style of our HTML in style.css. This is done by starting to edit with a (.) and follow up with a class name. For example: <span class="This">This</span>. For this 'this' I used span and classified it as 'This'. I can then input this in Style.css to make it look as red as it does:</p>

            <div class="polaroid-container">
                <div class="polaroid">
                    <img class="polaroid-image" src="images/Thiss.png" alt="This example">
                    
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>Pseudo-Classes & Links</h2>
            <p>CSS allows you to modify the appearance of links using pseudo-classes. <span>a:hover</span>, <span>a:visited</span>, and <span>a:active</span> let you change how links look based on their state (e.g., when clicked or hovered over).</p>

            <p>For example, <span>a:hover</span> { color: red; } makes the link change color when hovered, enhancing interactivity. Every time you click a link that takes you to another page, the clicked link, now 'visited', will change its color to purple because it was edited with <span>a:visited</span> to reflect that it's been clicked.</p>

            <p>Reflection: This is one of my favorites from style.css since it allows me to add quirky factors to many elements in my page.</p>
