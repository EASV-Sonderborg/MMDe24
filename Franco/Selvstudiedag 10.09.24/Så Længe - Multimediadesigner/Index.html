            <p> My name is Franco Casenave, and I am a new student at the Erhversakademi Sydvest in SÃ¸nderborg, specifically in the Multimedia Design department.
                I am 22 years old and someone who loves to design, as well as have fun creating things for the world to see. 
            </p>

            <h2>Where am I from?</h2> 

            <div class="polaroid-container">
                <div class="polaroid">
                    <img class="polaroid-image" src="Images/Olavarria.jpg" alt="Olavarria">
                    <div class="polaroid-caption">Olavarria, Argentina</div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                I was born in Argentina, specifically in Olavarria, a humble city with beautiful flowing rivers and small houses.
                I only lived there for 5 years and moved to Europe, as my family had a mission to reside in Denmark, courtesy of my grandfather's parting wish.
            </p>

            <h2> What can you learn from me?</h2>

            <p>
                Sometimes learning with a side-mate is easier than with a teacher, because the language is different, its fresher,
                and around your level of understanding. Looking at things together with me can provide a different more playful perspective to something way more technical.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                The best learning happens when you have someone next to you, walking the same path and sharing the same struggles. A classmate can teach you things a teacher never will, because you're discovering the journey together.
