            <h1>Figma</h1>

            <p>
                Figma is a cloud-based design tool used for creating user interfaces (UI), user experiences (UX), and collaborative design projects. We have been using it to collectively make designs and learn from each other.
            </p>

            <h2>Design</h2>

            <p>
                At first Figma seemed like any other editing program, for rearranging, design and such, but it proved to be
                more challenging than usual. We got the first task to simply design a layout for a page, including a header, footer, and some content.
            </p>

            <div class="polaroid-container">
                <div class="polaroid">
                    <img src="Images/Design basic.png" alt="Design" class="polaroid-image">
                    
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                This is the easiest task so far, and nothing much to look into other than basics of design. If I could reflect on it, I would
                avoid using very textured and thematic icons for social media. It is better to keep it simple.
            </p>

            <p>
                For a second task, we needed to replicate/recreate a design that was given to us but making sure we used the tools and explored around:
            </p>

            <div class="polaroid-container">
                <div class="polaroid">
                    <img src="Images/Attention.png" alt="Attention" class="polaroid-image">
                   
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                I would highlight the border-radius, the box shadow, and symmetry as things to figure out, since these are the foundation of 
                simple design. A good chance to learn how to guide through the design principles of Figma.
            </p>

            <h2>Auto-Layout</h2>

            <div class="polaroid-container">
                <div class="polaroid">
                    <img src="Images/Autolayout.png" alt="Autolayout" class="polaroid-image">
                    
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                This is the hate-love relationship I have with Figma. The Auto-layout. Auto-layout is an essential tool that allows you to 
                manually manipulate the dimensions of designs. It sounds simple, but handling it is quite bothersome, albeit useful. I struggle to use it,
                but it did not take long to realize that to master auto-layout is to master design. I still have much to learn about Auto-layout, but 
                I tried my best at handling it for the given task.
            </p>

            <div class="polaroid-container">
                <div class="polaroid">
                    <img src="Images/Bilka.png" alt="Bilkatask" class="polaroid-image">
                  
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                We had to replicate a menu from Bilka, using Auto-layout to design most of the placement. At first, I did the basic list-like Auto-layout for the text
                to have it in vertical position. Then I edited the vertical spacing of the words so their distance would be according to the shown specimen.
                Sometimes when I applied Auto-layout everything got displaced, and I could not figure out why. That is because I tend to position elements first
                then apply Auto-layout, when I should have used Auto-layout for positioning in the first place.
            </p>

            <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>

            <p>
                Visual hierarchy is a design principle that organizes and arranges elements on a page to guide the viewer's attention in a specific order of importance.
                It helps communicate the most important information clearly and efficiently.
            </p>

            <div class="polaroid-container">
                <div class="polaroid">
                    <img src="Images/VH.png" alt="VH" class="polaroid-image">
                   
                </div>
            </div>

            <ul>
                <li><span>Size:</span> Larger elements tend to grab more attention, while smaller elements are seen as less important. Designers use size to emphasize key components such as titles, buttons, or images.</li>
                <li><span>Color:</span> Color can highlight important elements and create visual interest. Bright, bold, or contrasting colors attract attention, while muted or harmonious colors recede into the background.</li>
                <li><span>Contrast:</span> Contrast is about the difference between elements (like light vs dark, bold vs thin). High contrast makes elements stand out, whereas low contrast makes them blend together.</li>
                <li><span>Alignment:</span> Proper alignment ensures that elements are organized and easy to follow. Good alignment creates order, balance, and a sense of connection between design elements.</li>
                <li><span>Repetition:</span> Repetition helps create consistency and reinforces a visual theme. Repeating elements like colors, fonts, or shapes builds cohesion in the design and strengthens the visual hierarchy.</li>
                <li><span>Proximity:</span> Elements that are placed close together are perceived as related, while elements farther apart seem disconnected. Grouping related elements helps organize content and guide users through the design.</li>
                <li><span>Whitespace:</span> Also called negative space, whitespace is the empty space between elements. It provides breathing room, helps avoid clutter, and directs attention to key areas of the design.</li>
                <li><span>Texture and Style:</span> Texture refers to the visual or tactile surface quality of an element. Different textures or styles (like flat vs 3D) can create emphasis or contrast and make a design feel more tangible and engaging.</li>
            </ul>
